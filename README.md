# Economic City Simulation

## Overview
This is an urban economic simulation that models the complex dynamics of a city's development, focusing on emergent economic patterns, resource allocation, and urban evolution.

## Features
- Detailed city grid with multiple cell types (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, etc.)
- Dynamic economic modeling
- Borough-level resource allocation
- Population movement and job dynamics
- Random historical events
- Multiple visualization layers (Economic, Population, Infrastructure, etc.)
- Emerging district specializations

## Simulation Mechanics
The simulation uses a cellular automata-like approach to model urban economic development, featuring:
- Economic value diffusion
- Population migration
- Resource competition between boroughs
- Dynamic cell type transformation
- Transport network effects

## Visualization
The simulation offers multiple view modes:
- Economic Heatmap
- Population Density
- Infrastructure Quality
- Transport Network Usage
- Happiness Levels
- Environmental Quality
- Crime Rates

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

### Pending Features
- **Policy Intervention System**: The "Policy Menu" button is currently a placeholder. 
  - The UI includes a policy menu option, but the full implementation of policy interventions is not yet complete.
  - Planned features include:
    * Economic policies
    * Social policies
    * Infrastructure development options
    * Urban planning interventions

## How to Run
1. Open the HTML file in a modern web browser
2. Use the controls to:
   - Regenerate the city
   - Start/Pause the simulation
   - Adjust simulation speed
   - Change visualization layers

## Interaction
- Hover over cells to see detailed information
- Click on borough statistics for more insights
- Experiment with different simulation speeds

## Future Roadmap
- Complete policy intervention system
- More granular economic modeling
- Transport network simulation
- Enhanced event system
- Machine learning-based urban development predictions

## Technical Details
- Pure JavaScript implementation
- Canvas-based rendering
- Cellular automata-inspired economic model
- Stochastic simulation with multiple interacting systems

## Limitations
- Early-stage prototype
- Simplified economic and urban development models
- Policy system not yet implemented
